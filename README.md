--->Hi, I'm @dc9865. 
    I'm interested in playing sports such as tennis, badminton, and basketball. I also like to code when i have free time. 
    I'm currently in a co-op program where my team and I collaborate and work on our project to create and build a web application for students and teachers/tutors to connect each other in an effective way in regards to education.
    I'm lookng to collaborate on coding.
